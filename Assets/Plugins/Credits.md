# Credits for Plugins
**First of all:**
I'm sorry that I included the files in the repo. I am working on this project together with begginers, and it is problematic to help them install dependencies, especially when they tend to change on daily/weekly basis. Here are the people that made this project possible (or at least easier):

[Semaeopus](https://github.com/Semaeopus): Unity-Lua and Unity-Logger
[Carl Halstead](https://github.com/CarlHalstead): Imgur API for Unity
[Moonsharp](https://github.com/moonsharp-devs): Powering the console LUA together with [Semaeopus](https://github.com/Semaeopus)'s API
[jocyf](https://forum.unity.com/members/jocyf.1484/): CloudToy
[Rotary Heart](https://www.rotaryheart.com): Serialized Dictionary
[Dented Pixel](http://dentedpixel.com/): LeenTween asset
