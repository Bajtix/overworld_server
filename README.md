# Project Overworld
This project started as a small experiment which's goal was to create a multiplayer game using the Unity game engine. Currently, it is developed only by me with occasional help from my friends. This repository is currnently public, but I will make it private after a full release of the game. 

## [  Check out the Client repo](https://github.com/Bajtix/overworld_client)

## The Idea
My goal is to create a open-world sandbox multiplayer, focused on the progression of the player (you start with nothing, then develop more and more advanced tools). Everything is kept in kind of Cyberpunk -ish style (Futuristic technology, but with retro styling and punk rock and synthwave music). In the lategame, players will be able to build massive factories and flying cities.

## The Lore
The action takes place on Earth, in the distant future. The year is around 2194. The planet has recovered after the Great Atomic War that destroyed almost all existance. You are one of the survivors that were hybernated... And that's all I currently wrote. Will finish later.

## What is already done
Most of the systems are almost finished and it is the matter of adding new content that will put them into use.
- Basic inventory system
- Vechicle system
- Building system
- Animation system
